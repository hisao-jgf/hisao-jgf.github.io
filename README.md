### [ **Only if you want to contact me directly via email:** ]

-   When trying to fill out the form you might be suggested the following by your web-browser: **_"This form is not secure. Autofill has been turned off."_**  
    It happens due to the **technology** current webpage is using (no server-side applications), which will ask you to choose a way of sending an email when submitting a form (Google Mail, Microsoft Outlook etc.)  
    The browser could possibly be **not** responsible for the application you're trying to send your details with, therefore it cannot surely guarantee that the details you share will be delivered to the receiver/me safely, but so does the application or service you're using, which the absolute most of are **completely safe**, using **TLS protocols** or the other form of data encryption.  
    This approach gives an ability to directly reach out to me in the most convenient way possible specifically for you :\)
